        <p>
          Few days back, I was tasked on a project. This app will be written in
          React. State management will be with Apollo with a backend in GraphQL.
          The way I learn new things is I do a very basic course to get the feel
          of it. I look for a free course, so that I can share it with the
          community. GraphQL being relatively new has fewer courses online. I
          did find a lot of resources both free and paid which I will review
          some day but this one course stands out. I have recommended this
          course to a lot many people I know.

          While this course covers a lot of ground, it misses few. Also, it is
          little bit outdated. Nonetheless, the course is still my favorite for
          beginners.<strong>pace</strong> is remarkably right, it’s neither too
          fast that you have to go back nor slow that you start doozing
          <strong>full screencast</strong> of code, I like where I don’t have to
          see someone’s face too much and the instructor explains things on
          codepad. So, this was a huge + <strong>great example</strong> for the
          entire tutorial as it covers why GraphQL is an ideal solution. TODO
          apps wouldn’t do justice to the concepts of GQL.

        <h2>what you need to know to do this course?</h2>
        <p>
          To do this course you need to know the following pieces of technology:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>NodeJS</li>
          <li>ExpressJS</li>
          <li>ReactJS</li>
          <li>CSS & HTML</li>
          <li>MongoDB</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you don’t know any of these, there are tutorials on NetNinja itself
          to help you with it. If you know all of it, (like I did), nothing can
          be better than this.

        <p>
          This is a full stack graphQL course. It covers everything you would
          need to make a graphQL app.
        </p>
        <h3><strong>FOR THE BACKEND</strong></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Mutations</li>
          <li>Queries</li>
          <li>Resolvers</li>
          <li>GraphiQL</li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <h3><strong>ON THE FRONTEND</strong></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>query/mutation fire</li>
          <li>parameterized query</li>
          <li>composing multiple query</li>

        <h2>after the course</h2>
        <p>
          As I said earlier, the course left a lot of grounds to cover. After
          you have done the basics you can learn about:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>graphql subscriptions</li>
          <li>@client i.e. managing local state</li>
          <li>typescript support</li>
          <li>authentication/authorization in the app</li>
          <li>writing tests for graphql query/mutations</li>
          <li>paginated queries</li>
          <li>
            most important: using apolloclient as renderProps which is the
            current API being used in apollo’s documentation and everywhere in
            code.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If you follow and complete the entire course, you make something like
          this: my booklist app
          <br />
          However, the course doesn’t cover how to host it online. I have hosted
          the entire frontend and backend server for free. If you like to know
          how to host a React+GraphQL app, subscribe to the newsletter below and
          whenever I write it, you’ll get it straight into your inbox.
